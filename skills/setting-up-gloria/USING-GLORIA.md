# Using Gloria

[Gloria](https://gloria.dev) keeps agent-written code aligned with intent. It
watches the places where implementation drifts from what the team wants —
dependencies, shared skills, project documents — and gives you, the coding
agent, tools to keep them in sync. This project has adopted Gloria: the
triggers below are commitments the team has made, not suggestions. When a
trigger matches the task you are doing, take the corresponding action.

Gloria is available two ways, and both apply to you:

- **MCP tools** on the `gloria` server (dependencies, skills library,
  documents, Doc Holiday).
- **Agent skills** installed with the Gloria plugin (invoke them by name; do
  not improvise their workflows by hand).

**Vocabulary — "register" and "sync" mean call a Gloria tool.** When the user
says **"register"** or **"sync"** a resource **with Gloria** — a dependency, a
project, a coding standard, a rule, a snippet, a document — they mean: call the
matching Gloria MCP tool (`put_dependency`, `register_project`,
`register_standard`, `put_rule`, `put_snippet`, `put_document`), **not** perform
the underlying action informally or just edit a file. "Register this dependency"
→ `put_dependency`; "sync my project with Gloria" → `register_project` (via the
`documenting-service-dependencies` skill); "register our standards" → the
`extracting-coding-standards` skill's `register_standard` / `put_rule` /
`put_snippet` flow. If a request names one of these resources with "register" or
"sync", route it to the corresponding tool or skill below.

## Keeping this file current

This file is written by the `setting-up-gloria` skill and stamped with the
plugin version that shipped it (see the first line). The first time you call
a Gloria MCP tool in a session, check the `latestAgentDocVersion` field that
`get_info` returns. If it is newer than this file's stamp, tell the user and
offer to re-run `setting-up-gloria` to refresh this file. Never edit this
file by hand — it is replaced verbatim on refresh.

## When to use Gloria

| The moment in your work                                                                                       | Required action                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| You added, removed, or swapped an external service, SaaS API, SDK, or API client                              | Update the dependency inventory: run the `documenting-service-dependencies` skill, or for a single obvious change sync directly with `put_dependency` / `delete_dependency` |
| You changed how an internal system is reached (new database, queue, internal API, or a changed endpoint/auth) | Same as above — internal dependencies are monitored too                                                                                                                     |
| The user asks what this project depends on, or whether a vendor/service is healthy                            | `list_dependencies` / `get_dependency` — answer from Gloria's inventory, not just from reading code                                                                         |
| You are about to author a new agent skill, or the user asks "do we have a skill for X?"                       | `search_skills` FIRST. Only author when nothing fits; follow the `using-the-skills-library` skill                                                                           |
| You built a skill or workflow worth reusing across the org                                                    | Publish it: `publish_skill` (see `using-the-skills-library`)                                                                                                                |
| The user wants a skill from an external marketplace the org subscribes to                                     | `list_marketplaces`, then `install_skill`                                                                                                                                   |
| You produced a durable project document (dependency inventory, architecture map, docs site map)               | Store it with `put_document` so teammates and other agents see it                                                                                                           |
| A Gloria tool reports the project is not registered                                                           | `get_info`, then offer `register_project`                                                                                                                                   |
| The user updated the Gloria plugin, or this file looks wrong or stale                                         | Offer to re-run `setting-up-gloria`                                                                                                                                         |
| The user asks for documentation to be written or updated via Doc Holiday                                      | Use the `doc_holiday_*` tools (see below)                                                                                                                                   |

## MCP tools reference

All tools run as the authenticated user against their active organization.
Reads need `inventory:read` (any member); writes need `inventory:write`;
`publish_skill` needs admin (`settings:manage`).

**Org & projects**

- `get_info` — org id/name/slug plus `latestAgentDocVersion`. Cheap; call it
  first when you need org context or a staleness check.
- `register_project` — register this repo as a gloria.dev project.
- `list_projects` — the org's registered projects.

**Dependencies (Canary)**

- `put_dependency` — create/update a dependency and its health-check
  definition. May return a Configure-secrets link when a check needs a
  credential; pass that link to the user, never ask for the secret in chat.
- `get_dependency`, `list_dependencies` — inventory and current status.
- `delete_dependency` — remove a dependency that no longer exists in code.

**Skills library**

- `search_skills` — search the org's library; always precedes authoring.
- `get_skill` — fetch a skill bundle (latest or a specific version).
- `publish_skill` — publish an immutable new version org-wide.
- `list_skill_versions` — a skill's version history.
- `list_marketplaces`, `install_skill` — external marketplaces the org
  subscribes to, and installing from them via the host agent's native
  mechanism.

**Documents**

- `put_document` — store a Markdown document against the project.

**Doc Holiday** (documentation automation; requires the org's Doc Holiday API
key, configured in gloria.dev Settings)

- Browse: `doc_holiday_list_publications`, `doc_holiday_get_publication`,
  `doc_holiday_list_conversations`, `doc_holiday_list_conversation_turns`,
  `doc_holiday_get_conversation_turn`,
  `doc_holiday_list_conversation_comments`,
  `doc_holiday_get_conversation_diffs`.
- Act: `doc_holiday_request_documentation` (new docs from a prompt),
  `doc_holiday_request_work` (follow-up work on a conversation).

## Skills reference

Invoke these by name when their trigger matches; each skill contains its own
full workflow.

- `documenting-service-dependencies` — map and document every external and
  internal service dependency, with health checks, and sync them to Gloria.
  Trigger: dependency changes; "document our integrations"; "what does this
  connect to?"
- `using-the-skills-library` — search/publish/install org skills. Trigger:
  about to author a skill; "do we already have a skill for this?"; sharing a
  reusable skill.
- `identifying-skills-for-a-project` — inventory the skills a project uses
  and recommend gaps. Trigger: "what skills would help this project?"
- `defining-the-documentation-site-map` — plan a Diátaxis-organized docs site
  from the source. Trigger: "what should our docs contain?"
- `setting-up-gloria` — wire Gloria into a repo (this file + instruction-file
  section) and offer registration. Trigger: "set up gloria"; plugin updated;
  this file missing or stale.

## First-time and recovery

- **Project not registered** — `register_project` needs `inventory:write`.
  Offer it once; if the user declines, continue without syncing.
- **MCP auth fails** — the user must log in to the `gloria` server: Claude
  Code `/mcp` → gloria → authenticate; Codex `codex mcp login gloria`;
  OpenCode follows its MCP auth flow. Until then, skills still work — queue
  the sync and mention it.
- **This file is missing, stale, or contradicts the tools you see** — trust
  the live MCP server, and offer to re-run `setting-up-gloria`.
